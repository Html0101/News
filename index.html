Emmanuel has been the Prime Minister for around 5 years but Boris Johnson (the UK's Prime Minister) doesn't particuallarly likes it becaus of his split from the EU and the history between the 2 nations.</p>

                <h1>Hepatitis Outbreak</h1>
                <p>Hepatitis (a virus which infects the lungs) has broken out and started in Europe and is now affecting both the USA and Western Europe.</p>
                <p>This virus is mainly affecting children and some can be fixed with a transplant.</p>
                <p>To stop it you must: If no water is available, boiling water is the best method for eliminating hepatitis A. Bringing the water to a full boil for at least 1 minute generally makes it safe to drink. Heated food should be hot to the touch and eaten right away and take the vaccine for both A and B hepatitis.</p>
